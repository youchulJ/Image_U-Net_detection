# Satellite Image Detection with Image U-Net

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a satellite image detection model using Image U-Net. The Image U-Net architecture is a powerful tool for semantic segmentation tasks, and in this project, it has been applied to detect objects of interest in satellite imagery.

## Features

- **Image U-Net Architecture:** Utilizes the Image U-Net neural network for accurate segmentation of objects in satellite images.

- **Satellite Image Dataset:** Trained and tested on a diverse dataset of satellite images, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.

- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
